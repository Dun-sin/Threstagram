## Rules

- Don't create a pull request on an issue that doesn't exist, create an issue first and if the changes you are proposing are said to be okay, you can go ahead and create a pull request

- Don't work on anything unless you are assigned, if you make a pull request without being assigned to that issue, it will be closed without being merged

- Don't work on more than one issue at a time, this is so that you don't make a huge pull request and others can have opportunities to work on another issue while you work on something else

- Do read the `readme.md` file

- Add the Issue you worked on in your Pull Request 

- Don't work on the main branch, create your own branch by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/Dun-sin/Threstagram/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#-how-to-make-a-pull-request)

- Don't commit the lock files eg package.json

- Fill out issue and pull request(PR) templates properly, if you don't know how, check out previous issues/PR to know how they are filled or this videoüëáüèæ

## How to add a theme
- create an issue with an image of the theme, don't add the theme unless you are assigned to the issue
- add the theme in it's respective theme file, if it's a light theme add to the `lightDesign.tsx` and export it but not default
- use a number to name the theme e.g `light-1`, if `light-1` already exists go with the next number `light-2` etc
- code the preview in `themes/index.tsx`, copy it and adjust to how it should look in the respective design type eg the `lightDesign.tsx` file
- call it in the switch statement in `DisplayTheme.tsx`
